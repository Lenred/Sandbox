        <h1>Welcome to My Cybersecurity Testing Ground</h1>
        <p>Welcome to this interactive platform, a personal project designed for exploring and understanding various aspects of web security. Here, you'll find a range of tools and environments to test and learn about cybersecurity in a practical way.</p>

        <h2>Testing Ground</h2>
        <p>The 'Testing Ground' is a section focused on the exploration of clickjacking techniques. It provides an environment to simulate and comprehend how clickjacking attacks operate, offering insights into protecting against such vulnerabilities.</p>

        <h2>Sandbox</h2>
        <p>The 'Sandbox' offers a virtual space for safely executing and examining untrusted code. This area is perfect for analyzing potentially harmful scripts, trying out new security concepts, or understanding the behavior of various code snippets in a secure, isolated setting.</p>

        <h2>Run Code</h2>
        <p>The 'Run Code' feature is a practical tool for writing, testing, and seeing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code come to life in real-time. It's ideal for quick experimentation, learning new web development techniques, or debugging pieces of code efficiently.</p>
